I am a fourth-year undergraduate at School of Physics, Peking University. Currently, I'm working on my thesis as an undergraduate research assistant at [Tanglab](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/tanglab/), which is part of the interdisciplinary institute [Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/index.php?lang=en).

I'm broadly interested in research that utilizes the tools and methodology of statistical physics to solve mysteries in living systems.
