I am a fourth-year undergraduate at School of Physics, Peking University. Currently, I'm an undergraduate research assistant at [Tanglab](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/tanglab/), which is part of the interdisciplinary initiative [Center for Quantitative Biology, Peking University](http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/index.php?lang=en).

I'm broadly interested in research that utilizes the tools and methodology of statistical physics to unravel mysteries in living systems. My research ranges from purely theoretical problems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to close collaboration with experimentalists in order to address specific biology questions.

I'll be applying for PhD positions this fall.
